<br>This is an arduino board and the square shaped thing in the right-downwards is called a chip.
<BR> We will be going to understand that square thing[chip].

 ### As seen, a chip is actually inside a package, and is connected to various "PINS" or inputs/outputs. The locations of the pins and what they are are usually driven by the design of the PCB. A chip is also a very complex system, and has various components such as -:

<br> 1. Pads = Pads in microprocessor chips are small conductive areas on the chip's surface that serve as connection points for electrical signals, power, and ground. They facilitate communication between the microprocessor and external components, such as circuit boards and peripherals. Pads can be categorized as input, output, power, or ground pads, and their design is crucial for ensuring proper functionality and signal integrity.

<br> 2. Core = A core in a microprocessor is an individual processing unit that can execute instructions. Modern CPUs often have multiple cores (e.g., dual-core, quad-core) to enable parallel processing, improving multitasking and overall performance. Each core can handle its own tasks, allowing for more efficient computing.

<br> 3. Die = A die is a small block of semiconducting material, typically silicon, that contains the integrated circuits (ICs) of a microprocessor or other electronic components. It is the physical piece of silicon that is cut from a larger wafer during the manufacturing process.

### Macros and Foundry Ip's

<br>Macros and Foundry IPs are essential components in microprocessor design. Macros refer to fixed, reusable design elements, such as standard cells or functional blocks, that simplify the design process. Foundry IPs, on the other hand, are specialized intellectual property provided by semiconductor foundries, tailored for specific manufacturing processes, ensuring compatibility and performance in chip production.
